# Project Overview

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data provided by the National Parks Service, focusing on species observed across various national park locations. By examining this data, we aim to uncover patterns related to species conservation status, prevalence, and distribution. This project involves scoping, analyzing, preparing, plotting data, and interpreting the findings to provide insights into biodiversity and species conservation efforts within national parks.

Key questions this project seeks to address include:

- What is the distribution of conservation status for various species?
- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
- Are there significant differences between species and their conservation status?
- Which animal species are most prevalent, and what is their distribution across different parks?

### Data Sources

The datasets utilized in this project are `Species_info.csv` and `Observations.csv`, provided by [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com). While inspired by real-world data, the datasets are primarily fictional and intended for educational purposes.

## Project Scope

Defining a clear project scope is essential for structuring the analysis and ensuring that the project goals are met. This scope includes:

1. **Project Goals**: The main objective is to act as a biodiversity analyst for the National Parks Service, focusing on understanding species characteristics, their conservation status, and their relationship with different national parks. This will aid in efforts to protect at-risk species and maintain biodiversity.

2. **Data**: The project will utilize two datasets that contain information about species and their observations within national parks. These datasets will be analyzed to address the project's goals.

3. **Analysis**: The analysis will involve descriptive statistics, data visualization, and statistical inference to understand relationships within the data. Key areas of focus include distributions, counts, relationships between species and their conservation status, and observations of species across different parks.

4. **Evaluation**: Finally, we will evaluate whether the analysis answers the initial questions. This section will reflect on findings, highlight any unanswered questions, and discuss potential limitations or alternative methodologies.

## Data Description

### Species Information (`species_info.csv`)

This dataset contains information about various species observed in the national parks. Key columns include:

- **category**: Taxonomic category of each species (e.g., Mammal, Bird).
- **scientific_name**: Scientific name of each species.
- **common_names**: Common names associated with each species.
- **conservation_status**: Conservation status (e.g., Endangered, Threatened) of each species.

### Observations (`Observations.csv`)

This dataset contains recorded observations of different species within national parks over the past seven days. Key columns include:

- **scientific_name**: Scientific name of each observed species.
- **park_name**: Name of the national park where the observation was recorded.
- **observations**: Number of observations of each species in the past seven days.

## Analysis Approach

The analysis will be conducted using the following steps:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: To summarize and describe the main features of the datasets.
2. **Data Visualization**: To create visual representations of the data, highlighting trends and patterns.
3. **Statistical Inference**: To test hypotheses and determine if observed differences are statistically significant.

## Evaluation

Upon completing the analysis, we will revisit the initial questions to assess whether they have been adequately answered. The evaluation will also consider insights gained throughout the project, potential limitations of the data or analysis methods, and suggestions for future research or alternative approaches.
